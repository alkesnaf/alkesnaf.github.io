    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="ub_socialwork_img.jpeg">
    <p>I grew up in St. Catherine, Jamaica, and moved to Brooklyn, New York in the 7th grade.<br>
        My first introduction toComputer Science was in my senior year of high school when I <br>
        took AP Computer Science Principles, which I loved.Coincidentally, this was around the <br>
        time of college applications and I was unsure of what to major in. I then decided to <br> major
        in Computer Science at the University at Buffalo(UB).</p>
        
    <p>Throughout my years at UB, I've met many influential professors who have guided my passion <br> 
        for learning. Notably, I've been working with Dr. Kenneth Joseph since my freshman summer, <br>
        where I've worked on many cool and meaningful projects that showed me how to conduct research <br>
        and introduced data science, among many other things. Dr. Ethan Blanton has also had a great <br>
        influence on me, as I was a teaching assistant for his Systems Programming and <br> 
        Distributed Systems courses.The things I've learned from these professors have <br> 
        greatly shaped my academic and professional career.</p>
