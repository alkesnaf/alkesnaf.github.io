    </div>

    <p>I grew up in St. Catherine, Jamaica, and moved to Brooklyn, New York in the 7th grade.<br> My first introduction to
        Computer Science was in my senior year of high school when I took AP Computer Science Principles, which I loved.<br>
        Coincidentally, this was around the time of college applications and I was unsure of what to major in.<br> I then
        decided to major in Computer Science at the University at Buffalo(UB).<br> Throughout my years at UB, I've met
        many influential professors who have guided my passion for learning.<br> Notably, I've been working with Dr. Kenneth
        Joseph since my freshman summer, where I've worked on many cool and meaningful projects that showed me how to
        conduct research and introduced data science, among many other things.<br> Dr. Ethan Blanton has also had a great
        influence on me, as I was a teaching assistant for his Systems Programming and Distributed Systems courses.<br> The
        things I've learned from these professors have greatly shaped my academic and professional career.</p>
