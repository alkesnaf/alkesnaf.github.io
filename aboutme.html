    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I grew up in St. Catherine, Jamaica, and moved to Brooklyn, New York in the 7th grade.<br>
        My first introduction toComputer Science was in my senior year of high school when I <br>
        took AP Computer Science Principles, which I loved.Coincidentally, this was around the <br>
        time of college applications and I was unsure of what to major in. I then decided to major<br>
        in Computer Science at the University at Buffalo(UB).</p>
    <p>Throughout my years at UB, I've met
        many influential professors who have guided my passion for learning. Notably, I've been working<br>
        with Dr. KennethJoseph since my freshman summer, where I've worked on many cool and meaningful <br>
        projects that showed me how to conduct research and introduced data science, among many other things.<br>
        Dr. Ethan Blanton has also had a great influence on me, as I was a teaching assistant for his <br>
        Systems Programming and Distributed Systems courses.The things I've learned from these professors<br>
        have greatly shaped my academic and professional career.</p>
